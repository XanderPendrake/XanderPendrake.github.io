<p>Xander Pendrake has been making up stories all their life nd writing them down since high school. They mostly write short stories, but upon discovering Twine they realized that they could easily create interactive stories as well. This site is a collection of their stories, wether they be prose or games made in Twine.</p>

<p>Xander is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns. They are also pansexual. As such, their stories often feature characters of different genders and sexual identities. They like to write diverse characters for the sake of hving diversity in their story. Fascists, homophobes, transmisogynists and anyone else who has a probem with diverstity may not like their stories.</p>

<p>If you experience a problem with this site or with any of the games listed on it, please emale Xander at missioncontrol@lunarpunk.space.</p>
