Welcome to the new website and future home of all my writing, Pendrake.ink! I am excited to finally have a portfolio website where I can showcase both my short stories and my Twine projects. I plan on using this site as more of a professional portfolio than a normal blog. That doesn't meant that there won't be posts about my life, but it does mean that this will be the site I direct people to if they are inerested in hiring me for freelance work. 

I primarily write short stories, but I'm also currently working on a piece of interactive fiction made with [Twine](https://twinery.org/) called _The Dragon of Greystone Tower_. It is a fantasy pastiche about a dragon who inherits a tower full of gold. It's a choose-your-own-adventure style game where the player decides how to handle the challenges that come along with being a dragon sitting on top of a a mound of treasure. The game is currently in the very earliest stages of planning. The plot and choices are currently being outlined. Hopefully I will have the gme done sometime in July.

In the meantime, I will be reposting stories from my other blogs on this site inn order to have them all in one place. Stay tuned for more of my writing both here on the front page and eventually on it's own separate page.
