# The Mind and Works of Xander Pendrake 

Welcome to the portfolio website for Xandar Pendrake, a Twine game developer and writer. Here you will find links to all of Xander's current Twine projects and short stories, as well as their biographical and contact information.

Xander currently has one Twine project in development, _The Dragon of Greystone Tower_. It is a fantasy choose-you-own adventure style game in which the player takes the role of a dragon who inherits a ruined tower and a hoard of gold and must deal with the humans who live nearby and fear them. It has no scheduled realease date as of yet and is in the very earliest stages of development.
