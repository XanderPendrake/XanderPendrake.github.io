<p><em>CW: Minor gore</em></p>

<p>John knew that there were courteous customers out there. Most of the time that was who he dealt with: the kind of customer who thanked you when you went the extra mile, or who asked you how you were doing without you having to ask first. The kind of customer you knew would fill out a good survey about you. The problem was that it was hard to keep those customers in mind when dealing with the annoying customers, like the one John had now.

<p>“What do you mean she’s at lunch?” demanded the red-faced man.</p>

<p>“Exactly what I said,” said John. “Our technician is at lunch and will be back in about twenty minutes. I can check the computer in for you–”</p>

<p>“I need to talk to her <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry sir, but–”</p>

<p>“Look, maybe you just don’t get it, Mr. Cashier,” said the red-faced man, “but this computer has some very important documents regarding the future of my consulting agency. It is very critical that that this computer gets fixed as soon as possible. Now get your technician back from her lunch break, or you’re going to have a very unhappy customer on your hands.”</p>

<p>A chill ran down John’s spine. He knew what happened to people who interrupted Tia’s lunch break. He still had nightmares about the noise he had heard the last time he tried to radio her. “I’ve been instructed to let her finish,” said John, “manager’s orders.” He prayed that the customer would buy it.</p>

<p>The red-faced man fumed. “Fine,” he said. “I’ll go find her myself.” He pointed to a door marked “Employees Only Beyond This Point.” “I assume the breakroom is that way?” he asked.</p>

<p>John liked to think of himself as a good person, and to him that meant being kind and keeping others from harm if he could. He liked to think that if someone, preferably someone hot, was about to be run over by a car, he would jump into the road and try to save them, throwing all caution to the wind. But as the red-faced man walked off in the direction of the break room, all John could do was stare. He knew what the customer was in for, and he was too terrified to warn the poor man. Soon enough, however, another customer was coming up to the register, and John managed to put the poor fool out of his mind for a while.</p>

<hr />

<p>Bart was not going to put up with this kind of bullshit. He was a buisnessman, goddammit, and he had clients who depended on him. Clients who would be very displeased if he couldn’t give them the highest quality service possible. And displeased clients meant less revenue, and less revenue meant angry shareholders. Couldn’t these retail rubes understand that? Did no one spare a thought for the shareholders anymore?</p>

<p>As he had guessed, the area behind the “Employees Only” sign did indeed lead to the breakroom. The door to the breakroom was closed, and a faint, flickering light trickled out from under it. Was the damn thing lit with candles? That would certainly be a firehazard if so, and he would be sure to mention it in the email he was going to write to the manager of this piece of shit store. That was, if he could get his damned computer fixed so he could send an email in the first place. Bart opened the door to the breakroom and prepared to yell a stream of insults at the unsuspecting technician, but when he saw the interior of the room his breath caught in his throat.</p>

<p>The room was dimly lit by candles, as Bart had suspected. What he did not expect to see was to to see some sort of ritual circle on the floor with a mound of what looked to be intenstines in the middle. And he certainly didn’t expect to see a reptilian creature wearing a <em>Gizmo’s Gadgets and Things</em> uniform hunched over the pile of intenstines, gore and viscera dripping from its maw. Its yellow eyes locked with Bart’s, and Bart caught a glimpse of a nametag on the thing’s chest with a pink heart-shaped sticker on it. The nametag read “Tia, Support Technician.”</p>

<p>“You should not have seen this,” said the creature. Bart wanted to scream as the thing unhinged its jaw and moved towards him, but all he could manage was a whimper.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tia returned from her lunch break a few minutes late. She straightened her back and yawned. A large meal always made her sleepy. She walked up to the drink cooler and grabbed an energy drink, then headed over to the cash register. John was working there and he was still visibly terrified every time he saw her, even in her human form. He was new, and hopefully he’d get used to her sooner rather than later. It seemed to be taking a while, though.</p>

<p>Tia placed the energy drink on the counter and gave John her employee id for the discount. John rang her out without looking her in the eyes even once. Tia was used to that sort of treatment from newbies, but that didn’t mean that it didn’t sting a bit. She sighed.</p>

<p>“Did you, uh…meet that computer customer?” said John.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Tia. “He was kind of stringy.”</p>

<p>“O-oh,” said John. “We, uh…probably could have used the sale.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a whole lot I would’ve been able to do,” said Tia. “He was still running <em>Vista</em> for crying out loud.”</p>

<p>That got John to look up and meet her gaze finally. “Seriously?” he said.</p>

<p>Tia smiled. Scratch a cashier at <em>Gizmo’s Gadgets and Things</em> and you would find a computer nerd underneath, albeit one without any certifications. Maybe she would be able to get John to come around after all. It would be nice to have another coworker to talk to, as long as he never asked what happened to the cashier who worked his shift before he did.</p>
