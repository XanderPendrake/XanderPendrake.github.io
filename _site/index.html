            <p><p>John knew that there were courteous customers out there. Most of the time that was who he dealt with: the kind of customer who thanked you when you went the extra mile, or who asked you how you were doing without you having to ask first. The kind of customer you knew would fill out a good survey about you. The problem was that it was hard to keep those customers in mind when dealing with the annoying customers, like the one John had now.</p>

            <p><p>The problem with reading horror stories before bed is that, of course, you can’t sleep. You tell yourself that it’s just an autonomous response to fear or that you’re just anticipating the nightmares that you might have. But deep down, you know that the real reason is that you’re afraid of something coming to get you in the middle of the night. So you read something else, or find something to watch (quietly with headphones). Or maybe you just listen to some music (again, quietly, with headphones) and stare at the ceiling for a time. Eventually, you are able to find a way to sufficiently distract yourself and go to sleep.</p>

            <p><p>Welcome to the new website and future home of all my writing, Pendrake.ink! I am excited to finally have a portfolio website where I can showcase both my short stories and my Twine projects. I plan on using this site as more of a professional portfolio than a normal blog. That doesn’t meant that there won’t be posts about my life, but it does mean that this will be the site I direct people to if they are inerested in hiring me for freelance work.</p>
