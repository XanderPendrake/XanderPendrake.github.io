    	Xander currently has one interactive fiction project in development, _The Dragon of Greystone Tower_. It is a fantasy choose-you-own adventure style game in which the player takes the role of a dragon who inherits a ruined tower and a hoard of gold and must deal with the humans who live nearby and fear them. It has no scheduled realease date as of yet and is in the very earliest stages of development.
